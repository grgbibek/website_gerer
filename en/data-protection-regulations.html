<div class="col-md-12">
<p>These data protection regulations apply for the SpyOFF product produced by Sareta S.r.l.</p>
<p>Personal data is subject to special legal protection. In order that this protection is as secure as possible, the following data protection regulations issued by Sareta S.r.l. are intended to explain the purposes for which we collect, process and use data.</p>
<p>If you still have any unanswered questions regarding the handling of personal data, please contact the responsible body:</p>
<p>SpyOFF is a product offered by Sareta S.r.l., Serravalle (R.S.M.) 10 Cardio Street, 47899 Serravalle, Repubblica San Marino, Email: support@spyoff.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Data collection</strong></p>
<p>Should you decide to register with SpyOFF, you will be asked to provide contact details as a means of identification. In addition, you will also be requested to provide payment details, which will enable the processing of payment in order to fulfil the mutually arising contractual obligations. Furthermore, we may also use your contact details to inform you of new products, improvements and changes to our service.</p>
<p>This data includes your first name and surname, your address details, telephone number and payment details, as well as a valid email. Individual details can of course be corrected if your circumstances change over the course of time. Your data will be saved for as long as your account with SpyOFF exists and the data is required to be available within the scope of legal obligations to retain records or the obligations under the contractual relationship. If it is no longer necessary to store the data and the legal obligations to retain records are terminated, they will be deleted.</p>
<p>As soon as you call up the SpyOFF website, we send one or more so-called cookies to your computer. The purpose of the use of such cookies is to tailor the Sareta S.r.l. website to your requirements as effectively as possible. A cookie is a small text file that contains a certain sequence of characters and uniquely identifies your browser. The use of cookies allows us to let you log into the customer area and to trace whether or not you have followed a specific link. You can prevent the use of cookies by applying the appropriate setting in your browser software. However, in this case you will not be able to use all of the functions of this website. Furthermore, when calling up the web pages, Sareta S.r.l. stores the URL referrer, your IP address and the date and time that the page was called up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Use of data within the scope of the purpose of the agreement and in certain other cases</strong></p>
<p>Sareta S.r.l. uses personal data for the purposes outlined below:</p>
<ol>
<li>a) The use of the services offered by Sareta S.r.l., as well as email advertising provided that the user has issued consent.</li>
<li>b) The continual further development and safeguarding of our offering, as well as the effective management of our services.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a rule, your personal data will only be collected, stored, processed and used for the described purposes. If the desired purpose has been achieved, your data will be deleted. The only instance whereby the deletion will not take place is if and to the extent that there is an obligation to retain the data under statutory provisions.</p>
<p>Recipients to whom the data may be sent for the purpose of the fulfilment of customer contracts are the external service providers. Otherwise, we only forward data that can be traced to you personally to other third parties, without your express consent, if there exists a legal obligation to do so. Statutory provisions may, under certain conditions, require us to forward personal data to investigating authorities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Security and responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Data that is stored on our servers is protected by means of the continual updating of our data security software. Particularly sensitive data will be transferred with a high standard of security (TLS technology).</p>
<p>Only the respective acting bodies are responsible for the collection, processing and use of personal data. Accordingly, Sareta S.r.l. is not responsible for adherence to data protection regulations on the part of these third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Amendment and deletion of your personal data</strong></p>
<p>If you have already registered with SpyOFF, you can update your name and address details and the settings regarding the receipt of newsletters yourself in the member area. For security reasons, it is not possible to amend payment details. If there have been changes to this data of which you would like to inform us, you can do this via the email support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Use of Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of the website will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. If IP-anonymisation is activated on this website, your IP address will be truncated within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases the whole IP address will be first transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing them other services relating to website activity and Internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Under no circumstances will Google link your IP address to other data retrieved by Google.</p>
<p>You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also opt-out from being tracked by Google Analytics with effect for the future by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Addon for your current web browser via the following link (<u>http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</u>).</p>
<p>Through the use of this website, you express your consent to the processing of data collected by Google about you in the manner described above and for the purposes previously mentioned.</p>
<p>Information on Google Analytics can be found here:&nbsp;<u>http://www.google.com/intl/de_ALL/analytics/</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Google AdWords and Google Display Network</strong></p>
<p>Our web page uses the online advertising systems Google AdWords and Google Display Network. Google affirms that it will protect the data of its customers and users. Google Adwords installs a cookie on your computer here. These cookies become invalid after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If the user visits certain pages of the web page of the Adwords customer and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the customer can see that the user clicked on the advertisement and was forwarded to this page. The information obtained as a result is used to draw up statistics, which are assessed in anonymised form. We also use these Google Adwords functions to speak to visitors of this web page again on web pages of third party suppliers or Internet users with specific interest profiles that are based on their Internet use. We do not collect any personal information here. This assessment is carried out in order to account for and evaluate advertisements and contains no personal data on you. Users who do not wish to take part in tracking can easily deactivate the Google Conversion Tracking cookie on their Internet browser under User Settings. These users are not included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
<p>We should point out that Google has its own data protection regulations. We assume no responsibility or liability for these regulations and processes. Please read Google’s data protection regulations before using our web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Validity and amendment of these regulations</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to amend these data protection regulations at any time. If amendments are merely insignificant, they shall come into force immediately. Should significant sections be amended, we will inform you by email one month before the amendment comes into force.</p>
